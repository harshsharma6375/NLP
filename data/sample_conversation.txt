Customer: This is the third time I’m contacting support. My iPhone 14 order from Amazon is still not delivered and no one has given me a clear answer.
Agent: I sincerely apologize for the repeated inconvenience. I completely understand your frustration and I will personally escalate this issue to ensure it gets resolved quickly.

Customer: Why was my refund request for the Lenovo laptop rejected? I returned it last week.
Agent: I understand your concern. The refund was delayed due to a verification issue, but I’ll make sure it’s processed as soon as possible.
